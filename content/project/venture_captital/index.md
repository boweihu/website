In my collaborative research with Olav Sorenson, I extend my exploration into the domain of entrepreneurial
finance, with a specific focus on venture capital. 

While existing studies predominantly concentrate on the influence of venture capital on organizational performance and regional economic growth, and some address supply-side drivers like low-interest rates, pension fund regulations, and allocations by limited partners, there remains a significant oversight. Particularly, the role of the local banking environment in shaping the venture capital landscape has not been adequately addressed. 

This research seeks to fill this gap by examining a critical question: How does the local banking system influence the growth and concentration of venture capital? Through this investigation, we aim to uncover the interplay between banking organizations and venture capital firms, providing new insights into the dynamics of entrepreneurial
finance.
