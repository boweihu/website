I am an organizational sociologist who studies household and entrepreneurial finance. I develop innovative theoretical frameworks inspired by organizational theories and adopt causal inference methods with large-scale quantitative datasets.

My dissertation, co-chaired by [Jennie Brand](https://soc.ucla.edu/person/jennie-e-brand/) and [Olav Sorenson](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/strategy/faculty/sorenson) and titled “[Households in the Red: How Banking Organizations Drive Their Debt](https://boweihu.com/project/1.-household_debt/),” examines the role of banking organizations, such as commercial banks and alternative financial services, in exacerbating household debt in the United States and other affluent democracies over the last two decades.

:trophy: My research has been awarded by the ASA, SASE, and ISA RC28, among others.

> Read my job market paper "[In the Red: How Bank Concentration Fuels Debt Burden for Households, 1995–2019.](https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fx2tu)"

> Read my 2024 ASA paper "[Banking the Unbanked Spurs Payday Loan Usage among Black Households.](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mbx7f)"

Outside of my scholarly endeavors, I find joy as a recreational tennis player.
